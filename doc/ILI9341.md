Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of each command in initialization for ILI9341 driver. Each entry explains the command’s role (when and why it is used), what the command does, and the purpose of its parameters.

1. **0xEF – (Undocumented/Extension Enable)**  
   • **Situation & Purpose:** Although not explicitly detailed in every datasheet, this command is commonly sent first to “prepare” the driver for the extended command set. It helps to initialize internal timing and power–related settings so that subsequent commands work reliably.  
   • **What It Does:** It switches on or enables certain undocumented internal functions or extensions.  
   • **Parameters (0x03, 0x80, 0x02):** These three bytes configure internal timing parameters and enable the extended command set.

2. **0xCF – Power Control B**  
   • **Situation & Purpose:** This command is used early in the initialization to set up power control related to the display’s power supply circuits.  
   • **What It Does:** It configures aspects of the power supply including oscillator and booster timing.  
   • **Parameters (0x00, 0xC1, 0x30):**  
  - 0x00: May disable or set a baseline for certain power functions.  
  - 0xC1 and 0x30: Define specific voltage or timing settings required for stable power-up.

3. **0xED – Driver Timing Control A**  
   • **Situation & Purpose:** This command adjusts the driver timing parameters that affect startup sequences and signal timing.

   • **Parameters (0x64, 0x03, 0x12, 0x81):** Each byte fine–tunes different aspects of the timing and power sequence (such as enabling/disabling certain timing circuits).

4. **0xE8 – Driver Timing Control B**  
   • **Situation & Purpose:** Used immediately after the first timing command, this further refines the driver’s timing configuration.  
   • **What It Does:** It adjusts additional timing characteristics and booster circuit settings.  
   • **Parameters (0x85, 0x00, 0x78):** These values set the delay and voltage timings essential for stable operation.

5. **0xCB – Power Control A**  
   • **Situation & Purpose:** This command is key for setting up the power control for the internal circuits that drive the LCD panel.  
   • **What It Does:** It adjusts the voltage levels for the power supply sections of the driver, helping to regulate the display’s operation.  
   • **Parameters (0x39, 0x2C, 0x00, 0x34, 0x02):** These five bytes determine the drive and voltage levels (for example, controlling aspects of the common electrode drive voltage and power sequencing).

6. **0xF7 – Pump Ratio Control**  
   • **Situation & Purpose:** Ensures that the internal DC–DC converter (voltage pump) delivers the correct voltage levels.  
   • **What It Does:** It adjusts the pump (boost converter) ratio that is used to generate the higher voltages required by the LCD.  
   • **Parameter (0x20):** Sets the ratio value so that the output voltages (such as VGH and VGL) are within the optimal range.

7. **0xEA – (Additional Driver Timing/Control)**  
   • **Situation & Purpose:** Often used to fine–tune or disable specific internal functions that aren’t needed for a given application.  
   • **What It Does:** It resets or sets to a default state some internal controls not otherwise used.  
   • **Parameters (0x00, 0x00):** These zeros usually indicate that no extra delay or alternate function is activated.

8. **0xC0 – Power Control 1**

11. **0xC7 – VCM Control 2**  
    • **Situation & Purpose:** Further refines the VCM setting to help stabilize the display output.  
    • **What It Does:** It fine–tunes the common voltage adjustment already set by the previous VCM command.  
    • **Parameter (0x86):** Provides an additional adjustment factor to the VCM level.

12. **0x36 – Memory Access Control**  
    • **Situation & Purpose:** Configures the scan direction, row/column order, and color order of the display data.  
    • **What It Does:** It defines how the display’s GRAM is accessed and how image data is written to the screen (e.g., orientation and mirror effects).  
    • **Parameter (0x48):** A value that sets specific bits to control row/column exchange, inversion, and RGB/BGR order.

13. **0x3A – Pixel Format Set**  
    • **Situation & Purpose:** Determines the format (or bit–depth) of the pixels to be used when writing display data.  
    • **What It Does:** It tells the driver how many bits per pixel are used (and how those bits are allocated to red, green, and blue).  
    • **Parameter (0x55):** Typically selects a 16-bit (5-6-5) format that provides 65K colors.

14. **0xB1 – Frame Rate Control (Normal Mode)**  
    • **Situation & Purpose:** Sets the refresh rate of the display in normal operation.  
    • **What It Does:** It adjusts the frame rate by defining parameters for the oscillator or internal clock division.  
    • **Parameters (0x00, 0x18):** The first byte might set the division factor while the second defines the period; together, they ensure a stable refresh rate.

15. **0xB6 – Display Function Control**

    • **What It Does:** It adjusts display settings like inversion mode, RGB order, and other functions affecting how the image is rendered.  
    • **Parameters (0x08, 0x82, 0x27):** Each byte controls a different aspect of the display function—for instance, defining the scan direction, the source driver output, and other timing details.

16. **0xF2 – 3Gamma Function Disable**  
    • **Situation & Purpose:** Disables an alternate gamma correction mode that might not be desirable for a given application.  
    • **What It Does:** It turns off the 3-gamma function to simplify gamma settings (using only the standard gamma curves).  
    • **Parameter (0x00):** A zero here disables the extra gamma function.

17. **0x26 – Gamma Curve Selected**

18. **0xE0 – Positive Gamma Correction**  
    • **Situation & Purpose:** Adjusts the brightness and contrast characteristics for the brighter portions of the display image.  
    • **What It Does:** It loads a set of parameters that shape the positive gamma curve (affecting how the display reproduces high luminance levels).  
    • **Parameters (15 bytes: 0x0F, 0x31, 0x2B, 0x0C, 0x0E, 0x08, 0x4E, 0xF1, 0x37, 0x07, 0x10, 0x03, 0x0E, 0x09, 0x00):** Each byte adjusts a segment of the gamma response curve for the red, green, and blue channels in bright regions.

19. **0xE1 – Negative Gamma Correction**

    • **Parameters (15 bytes: 0x00, 0x0E, 0x14, 0x03, 0x11, 0x07, 0x31, 0xC1, 0x48, 0x08, 0x0F, 0x0C, 0x31, 0x36, 0x0F):** These values fine–tune the negative gamma response for accurate dark tone reproduction.

20. **0x11 – Sleep Out**  
    • **Situation & Purpose:** Called after all the initialization commands, this command wakes the display from sleep mode.  
    • **What It Does:** It brings the driver out of low–power (sleep) mode so that it can start refreshing the screen.  
    • **Parameter:** None; it simply signals the driver to exit sleep mode (typically followed by a delay).

21. **0x29 – Display ON**  
    • **Situation & Purpose:** The final step in the initialization to make the display active.  
    • **What It Does:** It turns on the display output so that the contents of GRAM are visible on the screen.  
    • **Parameter:** None; the command directly enables the display.

Each command is sent in a specific order so that the ILI9341 LCD driver is correctly powered up, configured for proper voltage levels, timing, and image formatting, and finally brought out of sleep and turned on for normal operation.

This detailed explanation reflects common usage in many ILI9341 initialization routines and is consistent with the information provided in application notes and datasheets for the ILI9341 driver.
